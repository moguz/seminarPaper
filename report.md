Introduction
------------

Suppose that you are shown a picture of a bird, which you have not seen before in your life. Your brain immediately understands that the 
object in the picture is a bird, therefore all the previous knowledge you have gathered through past experiences regarding <em>birds</em> 
in general are attached to the bird image that you have just seen. Only by seeing a single image, you can guess the size of the bird, 
how would the bird looks like from other angles and whether the feathers on the back of the bird look similar to those you see on the image.
